# Macro Keyboard
This is a PCB design for a macro keyboard using the ESP32, I'm still writing the software to make proper use of this but the hardware is confirmed working.

It supports both USB and Bluetooth for keyboard input. It supports mechanical switches and has RGB LED's for below the keys. It can be used with a li-ion battery and has a USB port for charging and power.
